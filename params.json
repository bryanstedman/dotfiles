Alternatively, you can use the included alias `updatedotfiles`\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nThese dotfiles assume that you have Ruby installed.\r\nGit, [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) are also necessary, but the install script will get those installed for you if needed.\r\n\r\n### Customizing\r\nThese files provide a local.zsh file in the zsh folder for your own aliases and functions or pieces that are specific to one machine.  \r\n\r\nYou will also want to update git/.gitconfig with your name and email rather than mine\r\n","google":"UA-38615900-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
