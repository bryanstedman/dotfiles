Bryan's dotfiles
========

My OS X dotfiles. Most of these are stolen from other people.

# Installing
* Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles (`cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/bryanstedman/dotfiles.git .dotfiles`)  
* cd into this folder (`cd .dotfiles`)  
* run install script (`./scripts/install.sh`)  
* if you have a permission issue than make sure the script is executable (`chmod +x scripts/install.sh`)

# Requirements
These dotfiles assume that you have Ruby, Git and Homebrew installed.

# Customizing
These files provide a local.zsh file in the zsh folder for your own aliases and functions or peices that are specific to one machine.  

You will also want to update git/.gitconfig with your name and email rather than mine
